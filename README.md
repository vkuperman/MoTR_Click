# Mouse Tracking for Reading (MoTR) – Modified Demo

**Live demo:** https://vkuperman.github.io/MoTR_Click/  
If you see 404, see [PAGES_SETUP.md](PAGES_SETUP.md).

This is a modified version of [MoTR](https://github.com/wilcoxeg/MoTR) with **click-to-reveal** and character-based unblur:

- **Reveal on click only:** Text unblurs only while the mouse button is held; release hides it.
- **Reveal window:** 4 characters to the left and 14 characters to the right of the click position.
- **Recording:** One log row per click with position, duration, and position relative to word boundaries. Mouse movement during a click is ignored; the reveal stays fixed at click-start.

## Run the demo locally

1. **Install Node.js** (v16.x recommended): https://nodejs.org/

2. **Go to the demo folder:**
   ```bash
   cd run_motr_in_magpie/demo
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`) in your browser.

## Put this repo on your GitHub

You need **Git** installed: https://git-scm.com/download/win

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub (e.g. `MoTR` or `MouseTracking-MoTR`). Do **not** add a README or .gitignore there.

2. **Initialize git and push** from this folder (the one that contains `run_motr_in_magpie` and this README):

   ```bash
   cd C:\Seafile\ReadLabProjects\MouseTracking\Code\MoTR
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "MoTR demo with click-to-reveal and 4/14 character unblur"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your GitHub username and repo name.

3. To **run the demo from your GitHub repo** later: clone your repo, then `cd run_motr_in_magpie/demo`, run `npm install` and `npm run serve`.

## Structure

- `run_motr_in_magpie/demo/` – Runnable demo (Vue + Magpie) with the modified behaviour.
- `run_motr_in_magpie/provo/` – Provo experiment `App.vue` (same logic; needs full Magpie setup to run).
- `run_motr_in_magpie/attachment/` – Attachment experiment `App.vue` (same logic; needs full Magpie setup to run).
- `api/` – Upload-results serverless API (email + optional GitHub storage). See [api/README.md](api/README.md) for env vars and saving reports to GitHub.

Only the **demo** folder is set up to run with `npm install` and `npm run serve` from this repo.
